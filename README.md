**_ Presentation _**
This is a school project aiming to develop a CRUD REST API with Node.js and frontend interface with React. It may be shifted to Vue.js later.
Feel free to help or use (non commercially) AFTER MAY 20th, 2023.

3. Security

  Â¤ on sign-up form inform users they will not be able to update their username

_* MORE IDEAS FOR LATER *_

- Llife can be edited by owner player and Game Master on characters' cards. Players can add / edit statistics and powers on their characters.

- Sort search results alphabetically / by date (and reversed in both cases)

- Players can upload music in their messages, and the displayed messages can include a music reader if necessary.
